### Who holds Brazil’s biodiversity? The pivotal role of private landholders 
author: Andrea Pacheco

**Abstract:**
Brazil, a megadiverse country, has made efforts to link deforestation to individual properties through self-reported environmental registries. Yet, how these efforts support biodiversity, specifically, remains unclear. Here, we used an updated map of Brazil’s land tenure paired with newly developed biodiversity models to assess richness and endemism across tenure categories - and linked these results with estimates of property-level compliance with Brazil’s Forest Code. We found that private lands & claims and rural settlements had slightly lower biodiversity compared to all other tenure categories, but differences were typically negligible (Cohen’s d values between -0.14 and -0.06). We also found these lands represent >80% of the country’s native vegetation surplus and deficit (as legally required by the Forest Code), highlighting their pivotal role for current conservation and future restoration efforts. Safeguarding biodiversity requires policies that pair legal mandates with adequate incentives to engage all kinds of landowners/holders as conservation partners.
